# Cyberbullying Detection Project

## Overview

This project explores the identification of cyberbullying using a machine learning approach. It involves analyzing textual data, preprocessing for sentiment and content analysis, and training models to classify whether a given text contains cyberbullying.

## About the Dataset

Cyberbullying is a growing issue in the digital age, significantly impacting mental health and online safety. The dataset contains social media text data annotated for cyberbullying detection.

## Purpose:
To classify social media texts as containing cyberbullying or not, providing insights into patterns and helping build tools for safer online communities.

## Contents

* Data Exploration: Visualize word distributions and sentiment scores. Analyze trends in the text for bullying-related keywords.
* Data Preprocessing: Clean text data (e.g., removing stopwords, stemming/lemmatization). Encode labels for model training.
* Model Building: Implement machine learning models such as Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes for classification. Fine-tune hyperparameters for performance optimization.
* Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Insights: Identify patterns in cyberbullying behavior.

##Technologies Used

* Python: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
* Notebook Platform: Google Colab.

## Future Enhancements

* Expand dataset to include multi-platform texts.
* Incorporate deep learning approaches like LSTMs or transformers (e.g., BERT).
* Develop a real-time detection system.
